## What LinkerLee is

Browser bookmark managers are good at saving and bad at retrieval. Everything goes into a
folder tree, and a year later you cannot remember which folder.

LinkerLee makes a different bet. Paste a URL and it fetches the title, description, favicon
and preview image in the background, so you never file a bare link. You tag it once, and
**collections** assemble views of your links from tag rules — a link can belong to "Reading",
"Rust" and "This week" at the same time without being copied into three folders.

No social feed, no recommendations, no algorithm. Your links, organised the way you organise.

A hosted instance runs at **[linkerlee.com](https://linkerlee.com)**. The code here is MIT
licensed and self-hostable — see [Quick start](#quick-start).

## Browser extension

LinkerLee has an official browser extension, **Linkerlee Bookmarker**, developed in its own
repository:

### → **[linkerlee-app/linkerlee-browser-extension](https://github.com/linkerlee-app/linkerlee-browser-extension)**

Install it from either store, or build it from source:

- **Firefox** — [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkerlee-bookmarker/)
  *(Firefox, Firefox for Android)*
- **Chrome** — [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkerlee-bookmarker/mahiooindjjfeahbdmndhhkhigaopaek)
  *(Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi)*

Click the toolbar icon on any page and the popup pre-fills the URL and title, shows tags that
look relevant to the page content, and saves in one click. It also recognises pages you have
already bookmarked, so you edit instead of duplicating.

Pairing it with an instance:

1. In LinkerLee, go to **Settings → API tokens** and create a token.
2. In the extension's **Options**, set the **Base URL** (your instance, or `https://linkerlee.com`)
   and paste the token.
3. Click **Test connection**.

[![Settings → API tokens](docs/screenshots/api-tokens.png)](docs/screenshots/api-tokens.png)

The token value is shown once, at creation. Revoke any you no longer use — a token grants
write **and delete** access to your links.

The extension talks to the endpoints described in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) — chiefly
`GET /api/links/find` to detect an already-saved page and `POST /api/suggest-tags` for the
tag suggestions. `config/cors.php` already allows `chrome-extension://` and `moz-extension://`
origins, so a self-hosted instance works with it out of the box.

## Features

**Saving**
- Title, URL and description, with per-user duplicate detection
- Background metadata enrichment — title, description, favicon, preview image, page text —
  via a queued job *(needs a queue worker running; see [Configuration](#configuration))*
- URLs up to 2048 characters
- Missing scheme is filled in, so `example.com` saves as `https://example.com`

**Organising**
- Tags, with filtering from the links, dashboard and tags views
- Tag suggestions derived from the page's own text
- Collections: nested into a hierarchy, **and** definable as saved tag queries using
  and / or / not rules *(the code and the API call these `groups`)*
- An Inbox view for links that still need filing

**Working through**
- Search across links and collections (full-text on MySQL, `LIKE` elsewhere)
- Favourites, 1–5 star ratings, read/unread state
- Bulk editing across many links at once

**Lifecycle**
- Archive, soft-delete to trash, restore, force delete

**In and out**
- Import and export Netscape-format bookmark files — the format Chrome, Firefox and Safari
  all export
- Save by email: forward any link to your private inbox address and it becomes a bookmark
- A REST API, and the browser extension above

**Account**
- Registration, email verification, password reset
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP) with recovery codes
- Light and dark themes
- Delete all your data

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Laravel 12, PHP ^8.4 |
| Bridge | Inertia.js v2 |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI, shadcn/ui |
| Build | Vite 7, Laravel Wayfinder |
| Auth | Laravel Fortify (sessions + 2FA), Laravel Sanctum (API tokens) |
| Database | SQLite by default; MySQL 8 supported |
| Tests | Pest 4 |

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** PHP 8.4 or newer, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), and Node.js 22+.

You do **not** need MySQL. LinkerLee defaults to SQLite, which needs no server. If you would
rather not install any of this, [deploy it with Docker](#with-docker-recommended) instead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linkerlee-app/linkerlee.git
cd linkerlee
composer setup
composer dev
```

`composer setup` installs PHP dependencies, copies `.env.example` to `.env`, generates an
app key, runs the migrations, installs npm packages and builds the frontend.

`composer dev` then starts four processes together — the PHP server, a queue worker, the log
tailer and Vite — and the app is at **<http://localhost:8000>**.

Register an account at `/register`. Email verification is enabled, and with the default
`MAIL_MAILER` the verification link is written to `storage/logs/laravel.log` rather than sent.

## Configuration

Most of `.env` can stay as it ships. The settings that actually matter:

| Variable | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `DB_CONNECTION` | `sqlite` by default. Set to `mysql` (plus the `DB_*` credentials) for production — MySQL also enables the full-text search index, which SQLite does not get. |
| `QUEUE_CONNECTION` | Defaults to `database`. **A queue worker must be running** or link metadata is never fetched and saved links stay untitled. `composer dev` runs one for you; in production use `php artisan queue:work` under supervisor or systemd. |
| `MAILGUN_*` | Optional. Only needed for save-by-email. `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY` must be set or the inbound webhook rejects everything. |
| `LOG_VIEWER_ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated emails allowed to open `/log-viewer`. Empty means nobody — set it deliberately. |

## Development

```bash
composer dev        # server + queue worker + logs + Vite, all at once
composer dev:ssr    # the same, with server-side rendering
npm run dev         # just Vite, if you are running the PHP server yourself
```

**One gotcha on a fresh clone:** Wayfinder generates the TypeScript route helpers that
components import from `@/actions` and `@/routes`, and its output is gitignored. `composer
setup` produces it as part of the build, but if you ever see unresolved imports, run
`php artisan wayfinder:generate`.

## Testing

```bash
composer test                                    # Pint check + the full suite
php artisan test --compact --filter=LinkFilter   # one test
php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Api     # one directory
```

Tests run against in-memory SQLite while production runs MySQL. Anything depending on MySQL
specifically — the full-text index, column-length enforcement, collation — cannot be proven
by the suite; verify those against a real MySQL database.

## Code quality

```bash
composer lint         # Pint, fixes in place
composer test:lint    # Pint, check only (what CI runs)
npm run lint          # ESLint, fixes in place
npm run lint:check    # ESLint, check only (what CI runs)
npm run format        # Prettier, writes
npm run format:check  # Prettier, check only (what CI runs)
npm run types         # tsc --noEmit
```

## API

LinkerLee exposes a small REST API under `/api`, authenticated with a Sanctum personal access
token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens are created in the web UI at
**Settings → API tokens** — there is no endpoint that mints them.

> **Careful with `PUT /api/links/{id}`:** it replaces tags wholesale. A request that omits
> `tags` and `newTags` removes every tag on the link. To change only the title, resend the
> full tag set.

Full reference: **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**. There is also an OpenAPI 3 spec at
[docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml) you can import into Postman, Insomnia or Swagger UI.

The API is **unversioned and pre-1.0** — it may change. The browser extension is the reference
consumer; breaking changes will be coordinated with it.

## Deployment

### With Docker (recommended)

The repository ships a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` that stand up the whole
stack — nginx, PHP-FPM, **a queue worker** and MySQL 8 — from one command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linkerlee-app/linkerlee.git
cd linkerlee
cp .env.docker.example .env

# Generate an app key and paste it into APP_KEY in .env
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint php app artisan key:generate --show

# Set your own DB_PASSWORD and DB_ROOT_PASSWORD in .env, then:
docker compose up -d --build
```

LinkerLee is then at **<http://localhost:8000>** — register at `/register`. With the
example file's `MAIL_MAILER=log`, the verification email is written to the log instead of
sent; read it with `docker compose logs app` or at `/log-viewer`.

| Service | What it does |
|---|---|
| `web` | nginx on the port set by `APP_PORT`, serving `public/` and the built assets |
| `app` | PHP-FPM. Runs the migrations and warms the config, route and view caches on startup |
| `queue` | `php artisan queue:work` — **the metadata fetcher**. Without it, saved links stay untitled |
| `mysql` | MySQL 8, which is also what enables full-text search |

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app queue          # follow the application logs
docker compose exec app php artisan ...   # run any artisan command
docker compose down                       # stop; volumes (database, storage) survive
docker compose up -d --build              # apply an update; migrations run automatically
```

Two things worth knowing before putting it on the internet:

- **Nothing in the stack terminates TLS.** Put a reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik, nginx) in
  front of `web`, and set `APP_URL` to the public `https://` address. The bundled nginx
  honours `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so Laravel generates `https://` URLs behind such a proxy.
- **Change `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`** before the first `up` — MySQL only reads
  them when it initialises its volume.

To use an external database instead of the bundled one, point `DB_HOST` at it and remove
the `mysql` service (and the `depends_on` entries referencing it) from `docker-compose.yml`.

### Without Docker

A conventional PHP deployment:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm ci && npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan optimize
```

Then run `php artisan queue:work` as a supervised long-running process. Without it, metadata
enrichment silently never happens — this is the single most common self-hosting mistake.

## Roadmap

Not built, but intended. Listed here so nobody mistakes intent for reality:

- Comments and discussion threads on links
- Version history and change tracking
- Scheduling and reminders for links to revisit
- Outbound webhooks for link events
- An analytics dashboard for activity and popular tags
- A Safari extension
- Mobile apps
