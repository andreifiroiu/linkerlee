                    Linkerlee is a bookmarking service. It stores the links you
                    save so you can find them again — nothing more. There are no
                    analytics scripts, no advertising, and no third-party
                    trackers anywhere in the product.

                <p>
                    When you save a link, our server requests that page once, in
                    the background, to enrich the bookmark. From the response we
                    store the page title and description (only where you left
                    those blank), the favicon URL, a preview image URL, and the
                    page&apos;s visible text, which is what makes full-text
                    search across your library work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That request comes from our servers, not from your browser.
                    It carries none of your cookies, credentials, or identity,
                    so the site you bookmarked cannot tell which Linkerlee user
                    saved it. The extracted text is stored against your bookmark
                    and is visible only to you and to anyone you deliberately
                    share that link with.
                </p>
                <LegalNote>
                    Bookmarking a page behind a login will not capture anything
                    private: our server sees only what an anonymous visitor
                    sees.

                    Every account gets a private inbox address containing a
                    random 24-character token. Forward or send a message to it
                    and Linkerlee turns it into a bookmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take the first URL we find in the message, and a title
                    derived from the subject line. The message body is not kept:
                    once the URL and title have been extracted, the rest is
                    discarded. Our inbound mail provider processes the message
                    in transit and applies its own retention to delivery logs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treat the inbox address like a password. Anyone who learns
                    it can add bookmarks to your account — they cannot read,
                    change, or delete anything. If it leaks, contact us and we

                    You can turn a link or a group into a public, read-only

                    A share page is reachable by anyone who has its URL. The URL
                    is unguessable, but it is not secret: it can be forwarded,
                    posted, or indexed by a search engine that encounters it.
                    Anything on a shared page — titles, descriptions, tags,
                    saved URLs — should be treated as public. Deleting the share
                    takes the page down; copies other people already made are

                    Each acts as a processor under contract, on our
                    instructions, and none of them may use your data for their
                    own purposes. If we ever add or change a processor, this
                    section changes with it.

                <p>
                    We keep your account data for as long as your account
                    exists. Deleting a link moves it to Trash, where it stays
                    until you restore it or delete it permanently — an emptied
                    Trash is gone from the database, not merely hidden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can delete your account at any time from Settings →
                    Profile. Doing so removes your profile, every bookmark you
                    saved, your tags and groups, your API tokens, and any share
                    pages you published. Backups roll off on their own schedule,
                    within thirty days, after which the deletion is complete
                    everywhere.

                    Under the GDPR you have the right to access your data, to
                    correct it, to erase it, to restrict or object to its
                    processing, and to take it elsewhere in a portable format.
                    Most of these you can exercise yourself without asking us:

                        bookmarks file in the standard format every browser
                        reads. The REST API gives you the same data

                        whole account from settings.

                    All traffic is served over HTTPS. Passwords are bcrypt
                    hashed, two-factor secrets and recovery codes are encrypted

                    two-factor authentication is available on every account, and
                    turning it on is the single most effective thing you can do
