                    To run the service we need your permission to do the obvious

                    and display it publicly on any page you choose to share.
                    That permission is limited to operating Linkerlee, is
                    non-exclusive, and ends when you delete the content or your

                    indirect or consequential loss, lost profits, or lost data
                    arising from your use of the service. Where liability cannot
